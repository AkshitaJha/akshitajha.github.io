I'm a Research Scientist at Apple, broadly working on the safety of generative models. My research centers on fairness, interpretability, and robustness in generative models, with a particular focus on natural language processing (NLP). 

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, where I was advised by [Dr. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). During my doctoral studies, I also worked at [Google Research](https://research.google/teams/responsible-ai/) with [Vinodkumar Prabhakaran](https://cs.stanford.edu/~vinod/) and [Sunipa Dev](https://sunipa.github.io/), studying vulnerabilities in generative models at scale across text and visual modalities. 
Earlier, I interned at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, collaborating with [Dr. David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Dr. Libby Hemphill](https://www.libbyh.com/) on identifying offensive comments and de-escalating conflicts on social media platforms. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [IIIT, Hyderabad, India](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).
