I'm a final year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Virginia Tech advised by [Dr. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). My research interests fall broadly under the umbrella of trustworthy and responsible AI with a focus on fairness, interpretability, and robustness of generative models -- particularly in the domain of natural language processing (NLP). I focus on building systems that are fair and robust across text, code, and visual modalities. I have also interned at [Google Research](https://research.google/teams/responsible-ai/) where I worked with [Vinodkumar Prabhakaran](https://cs.stanford.edu/~vinod/) and [Sunipa Dev](https://sunipa.github.io/) on identifying vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) across text and visual modalities, at scale.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a research intern at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I worked with [Dr. David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Dr. Libby Hemphill](https://www.libbyh.com/) on identifying offensive comments and de-escalating conflicts on social media platforms. I also worked briefly as a software engineer at [Intuit, India](https://www.intuit.com/in/). Before that, I completed my MS by research in Computational Linguistics and Bachelors in Computer Science from [IIIT, Hyderabad, India](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).
