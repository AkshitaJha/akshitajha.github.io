I'm a 4th year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech advised by [Dr. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). My research interests fall broadly under the umbrella of trustworthy and responsible AI with a focus on fairness, interpretability, and robustness of deep learning models -- particularly in the domain of natural language processing (NLP). I work on identifying vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) and building systems that are fair, interpretable, and robust to adversarial perturbations in the input.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a research intern at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I worked with [Dr. David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Dr. Libby Hemphill](https://www.libbyh.com/) on identifying offensive comments and de-escalating conflicts on social media platforms. I also worked briefly as a software engineer at [Intuit, India](https://www.intuit.com/in/). Before that, I completed my MS by research in Computational Lingiustics and Bachelors in Computer Science from [IIIT, Hyderabad, India](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).
