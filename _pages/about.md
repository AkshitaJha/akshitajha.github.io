I'm a final year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Virginia Tech advised by [Dr. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). My research interests fall broadly under the umbrella of trustworthy and responsible AI with a focus on fairness, interpretability, and robustness of generative models -- particularly in the domain of natural language processing (NLP). I work on identifying vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) and building systems that are fair, interpretable, and robust to adversarial perturbations across code, text, and visual modalities.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a research intern at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I worked with [Dr. David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/) and [Dr. Libby Hemphill](https://www.libbyh.com/) on identifying offensive comments and de-escalating conflicts on social media platforms. I also worked briefly as a software engineer at [Intuit, India](https://www.intuit.com/in/). Before that, I completed my MS by research in Computational Linguistics and Bachelors in Computer Science from [IIIT, Hyderabad, India](https://www.iiit.ac.in/).
